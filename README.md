I  created and tested all functions; everything works well. But the overall objective still stands—we want to improve the website and flow of the users to increase purchases. So, let’s look at the data for insights that can be extracted.

First, we can look at the difference in page count and presence for the different plans. For this to be relevant and compared, we need to check the total amount of pages or journeys because there could be different amounts of monthly and annual users. What can be seen is the relatively high presence of the resource center for users that purchased a yearly plan.

This may suggest that people are comfortable subscribing to our platform for extended periods because of the high quality of resources we provide.

But correlation doesn’t always imply causation, which might be the case here. People already interested in long-term learning are the ones who check out the Resource Center. And, of course, those will be the ones to purchase an annual plan.

This hypothesis can be considered if we look at the page presence rather than the absolute count. In this metric, the Resource Center is present in about 12% of the journeys of monthly users and around 14% of the annual journeys. This is a slight increase, but ultimately, insignificant, given our sample sizes of ~300 and 900 journeys. The increase in total page counts is much more significant than the increase in the presence of this page, indicating that there aren’t more annual people who look at these resources, but the ones that do, stay for much longer.

Another difference between monthly and annual users can be found when we look at the destination pages after the homepage. For the monthly side, Pricing is ranked 5th highest with 102 clicks, while for annual users, it’s the second highest follow-up after the homepage, with 329 clicks.

This is a bit difficult to conclude, but the annual users were more ready to purchase even at the beginning of their journey. We would want to attract and spend marketing resources on these visitors because they’re more inclined to buy the product, not just the annual plan. After all, going to pricing immediately indicates they want to consider the best option.

Another interesting observation is that monthly users often check out the career tracks page. This page contains our course library grouped into several sequences called ‘career tracks.’ It structures the potential learning process by saying, “Hey, you want to become proficient in this field? Then, take these courses in this order.” This construct caters to those with short-term goals or wanting to learn this specialty. It’s difficult to say whether those types of people wouldn’t have subscribed if we didn’t provide career tracks or if they would have maybe chosen more long-term plans.

The preprocessing options depend on what you want to take away from the analysis, and many combinations can be tried. Regarding which sessions to group, the first few sessions can indicate the users’ assumptions and objectives before getting to know the platform. This can help you identify the general behavior of the user.

The last sessions are cluttered, with many log-ins and checkouts. But among the clutter, you can see if a page convinced the user to purchase. These previous sessions may include the tipping point. As for pages to be removed, the apparent candidates are ‘Log in,’ ‘Checkout,’ and ‘Sign up.’

Finally, and importantly, consider whether this is a complete analysis and if more data would synergize with this analysis. There is further research to help us with more accurate conclusions. Consider what is at the heart of our analysis: checking out pages visited by those who purchased a plan to see a pattern. But how can we only extract a pattern by looking at the subscribed users? Fundamentally, the only thing we can do with this data is to compare monthly vs quarterly vs annual users. But we can’t make any assumptions about which page encourages people to buy the product. For that, we need to compare the user journeys of those who purchased against those who didn’t.

This analysis can only be complete if we include the users who didn’t purchase.
